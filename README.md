# Blank Codesandbox Starter Template 

[![Edit in CodeSandbox](https://assets.codesandbox.io/github/button-edit-lime.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/flumpus-dev/codesandbox-blank-start)

This is a starter project that can be used as a template for new sandboxes on [the Codesandbox platform](https://codesandbox.io), a cloud-hosted in-browser IDE service that can be used for convenient and free remote development. I'd highly recommend using codesandbox, it's an excellent service that doesn't cost anything to get a very good deal out of.

## Contents

The template will create a new [cloud sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud#what-is-a-cloud-sandbox) using [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Nix](https://nixos.org). These are both built-in features for cloud sandbox configuration, and fhis template provides a stripped-down setup for utilizing these tools. I'd like to evetually expand this a bit to have some built in bootstrapping options, but for now it's mainly just for my own convenience.

## Additional Resources

More details on the options for using nix and docker in codesandbox can be found in [their documentation](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/tutorial/getting-started-with-docker).
